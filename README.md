# SAAS-RBAC

## Description

A pluggable _role based authentication and authorization_ module built for [NestJS](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework.

<br/>

## Project Setup

Copy the `src/modules/rbac/` directory in your project.

**Please Note:** This module is dependent on [TypeORM](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm) so if you're using a different ORM like [Sequelize](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/), [Knex.js](https://github.com/knex/knex), or [Prisma](https://github.com/prisma/prisma), you'll have to update the code for **entities**, **repositories**, etc accordingly. Please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/database) of NestJS for further reference.
